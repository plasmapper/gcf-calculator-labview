# GCF Calculator Library for LabVIEW
Mass flow meter/controller actual flow rate calculation library that uses gas conversion/correction factors (GCF).

## Features
1. Several selectable sources of GCF data. 
2. Simple mixture GCF calculation based on volumetric part of gases in the mixture.  

## Examples
### Flow Rate Calculator.vi
Example VI that demonstrates all library features.
